        <summary>Vim-fork focused on extensibility and agility.</summary>
        <description>More powerful plugins
The msgpack API enables structured communication to and from any programming language. Remote plugins run as co-processes that communicate with Neovim safely and asynchronously.

Better out-of-the-box
Strong defaults
Modern terminal features such as truecolor and bracketed paste
Built-in terminal emulator
First-class embedding
GUIs (or TUIsâ€”such as readline) can nvim --embed or communicate via TCP socket using the discoverable msgpack API.

Drop-in replacement for Vim
Neovim is an extension of Vim: feature-parity and backwards compatibility are high priorities. If you are already familiar with Vim, see :help nvim-from-vim to learn about the differences.</description>
